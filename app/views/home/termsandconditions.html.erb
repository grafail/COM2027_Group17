        <br>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
        To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

        <span data-custom-class="body_text" style="font-weight: bold; size: 20px" >Exceptions to Arbitration</span>
        <br>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
        (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
        (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
